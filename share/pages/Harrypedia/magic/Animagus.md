The common fan fiction idea is that you do not choose your animagus animal. I am
not sure what basis if any this has in the Cannon books, much less the somewhat
less canonical stuff that Mrs. Rowling has included in the various websites and
interviews dedicated to the series. However, we do have one quote that
_suggests_ otherwise:

> At a recent International Symposium of Animagi, the Uagadou School Team
> attracted a lot of press when their exhibition of synchronised transforming
> caused a near riot. Many older and more experienced witches and wizards felt
> threatened by fourteen-year-olds who could turn at will into elephants and
> cheetahs, and a formal complaint was lodged with the International
> Confederation of Wizards by Adrian Tutley (Animagus: gerbil).[^210304-6]

If you do not choose your animal, a school team composed of people who are _all_
dual animagi elephants and cheetahs is not really plausible. My guess is that
there are different ways to achieve the animagus transformation.[^211129-1] If
we posit that, then it is possible that the particular method that European
wizardry has adopted and/or discovered a method that _does_ include an
involuntary choice of animal, and _does_ limit you to a single animal. Being
typically arrogant, the British are unwilling to consider that someone else
might have a better approach. When it is rubbed in their faces, Mr. Tutley of
course reacts with a law suit - if you are better than me, you must have done
something reprehensible.

Some writers have suggested that at least some versions of the animagus
transformation result in changes to the human, just as there are identifying
marks on the animal.[^210514-9] This would explain Madam Hooch's
eyes.[^210618-9]
