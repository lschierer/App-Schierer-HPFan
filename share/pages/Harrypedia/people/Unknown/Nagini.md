title: Nagini
author: Luke Schierer

Mrs. Rowling, across a whole series of Twitter comments documented in the
footnotes of the [Wiki Aricle][HPWMaledictus] written about Nagini, reveals that she was
once fully human, and that a [maledictus] is a human female suffering from
a type of hereditary magical curse that causes them to, over time, irrevocably
transform into an animal.[^250808-1]  Assuming these comments, and the related material
from other [teriary sources] is taken as canonical, we are left with an information gap - who,
precisely, was she before she became [Riddle]'s familiar and [horcrux]?
