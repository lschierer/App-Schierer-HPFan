title: Genealogical Gaps - People with Unknown Surnames
author: Luke Schierer
---

The Harry Potter series provides genealogical information about wizarding families if
read carefully, but **many** gaps remain. The people listed below are known to exist
from the source material, but their surnames are not provided.

These represent real genealogical puzzles - for example, we know Fleamont Potter was
named after his mother's maiden name, but we don't know what her first name was,
or whether certain characters are related by blood or marriage.

This genealogical reconstruction is based on information from [canonical sources]. Where
relationships are ambiguous or surnames unknown, individuals are listed here rather than being
assigned to speculative family groupings.

I have not included here the many many more people who we know *must* exist but for whom we know
*neither* first nor last name, only those for whom at least one portion of their name is known
are included.
