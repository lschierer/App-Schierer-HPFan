# My Harry Potter Fan Fiction

The stories here are works that fit into one of three categories:

* where I am the primary author,
* where I have picked up an abandoned fan fiction story with the intent to extend and
(perhaps someday) finish it,
* where the excellent work done by [archive.org] is not *quite* sufficient, in that the story is either missed by its spiders, or (more frequently), requires minor editing for the best experience.

While I have not yet gotten the site to reflect it as well as I would like, the page metadata *does* reflect the author correctly for the second two categories.  A future version of this site will correct that technological shortcoming. Lastly, for the first two categories, the more I work on these stories, the
more I realize that I lack the attention span and persistence to follow through
on these to completion.  I have come to realize that this is primarily an exercise in my own amusement - and it does occassionally amuse me to work on one or more of them.  Thus there is no reason to post them anywhere else.
