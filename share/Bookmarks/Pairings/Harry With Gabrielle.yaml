title: Stories Featuring Harry Paired with Gabrielle
comments: |
  This pairing has to be *very* carefully handled to not simply come across as creepy. While no one blinks at a five year age gap between people in their thirties, even a two year age gap will get a second look when dealing with high school students. While we do not know how old [Gabrielle] is with any true certainty, it is safe to say that she is way too young for fourteen year old [Harry] when they first meet.

      This story handles the age gap in two ways:
      * They do not get together until some time has passed,
      * The gap is a problem for [Harry], but magic is not always kind, nor always able to be undone.

      This handles the age gap because, through no fault of either party, [Harry] has been in magical stasis for sufficient time that there no longer *is* an age gap.
