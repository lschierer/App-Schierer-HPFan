  Sally-Anne [Perks] is the character that disappears between the sorting in book 1 and the time students are
  called in for their OWL practicals in book 5. As we know literally nothing about her except her name, she is
  the perfect blank slate for a fan fiction author.

      The idea of a magical tatoo that indicates soul mates is a reasonably popular trope in fan fiction.  This story combines that with the [Harry] leaves Britain theme.
