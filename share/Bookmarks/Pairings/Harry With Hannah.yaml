  I really feel that [Hannah] is an under utilised character in fan fiction. Sure she backs down from her defence
  of him in second year and ends up wearing a badge in fourth, but both of these essentially boil down to the fact
  that she is a [Hufflepuff] and not a [Gryffindor] - she _isn't_ brave, and getting along with (showing loyalty
  to) her housemates is _massively_ important to her. The latter however can easily be transferred to [Harry] by
  a romantic attachment overriding the House loyalty, as my first entry in this category does.

      This one is a really interesting story in many ways despite a few irritating flaws.  I dislike the relationship that [Harry] has with [Hermione] and, to a lesser extent, [Ginny].  I think that his relationship with [Hermione] is in particular too romantically inclined, particularly in the earlier chapters.  I think the whole crucifixion scene is overboard; and lastly the obvious solution to the marriage contract it uses is breach of contract on the [Patil]'s side.  I am unsure why the author did not go that route.  These things aside, the story is excellent, with some really strong ideas.

      This is a really short one shot, but it had much potential to be developed into a longer story.  Like many of this author's stories, it focuses on how important a relationship with the right girl would be for [Harry].  This one features a view of [Hannah] that lets the reader easily see her growth from the girl we seen in second year to the girl who we are told (semi-apocryphally) takes over the Leaky Cauldron.

      Another one shot, the pairing is very much in the background here.  I almost included this in responsible adults instead.
