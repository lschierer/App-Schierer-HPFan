  For some reason this pairing is incredibly rare, and even more rarely are these stories actually finished. I am
  unsure why, as [Cho]'s character in the cannon books is clearly not a good romantic match for [Harry], and yet
  the introduction of Chinese culture, or even psuedo-chinese culture allows for some interesting crossovers, or at
  least minor additions to the canon universe (cameos within the universe as it were).

      The Resurection Stone is incredibly dangerous, perhaps the most dangerous of the three Hallows. This story explains one way that is true.
