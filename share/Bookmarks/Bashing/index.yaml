title: Stories Notable for Bashing a Particular Character
name: Bashing
comments: |
  As I note in the [people section] of the [Harrypedia], the characters across the Harry Potter Universe are
  largely complex characters whom the author has attempted to portray as *not* being complex, but instead tried
  to make fit into "good guy" and "bad guy" molds.  Some of these stories are noteworthy because the way that
  so many people, sites, and stories I have read ignore the obvious flaws of a character annoys me, and the configs:
  story bookmarked here provides a nice counterpoint.  Some are noteworthy because, sometimes by over-emphasizing,
  sometimes not, they highlight a particular flaw that is worth highlighting.  Some are noteworthy because in
  doing so they result in a particularly enjoyable story.
