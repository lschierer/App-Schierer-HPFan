  In general I prefer to sort based on the relationships involved. Where that is not true, based on what is
  happening (in the story) with [Harry].

  These stories are notable because you do not always have a happy ending.

      Usually [Harry] is shown embracing many of [Dumbledore]'s flaws - he is naively forgiving, keeps secrets, and struggles with real emotions. We see here that this leads to problems, but this version of [Harry] does not give infinite second chances.
